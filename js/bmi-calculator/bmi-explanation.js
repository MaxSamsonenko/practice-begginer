	"It's important to remember that BMI is a screening tool and does not provide a complete picture of an individual's health. Other factors, such as body composition, genetics, and overall lifestyle, also play a crucial role. Therefore, personalized recommendations should be based on a comprehensive assessment by a healthcare professional. Additionally, weight should not be the sole focus; overall health and well-being should be the primary goals.";
